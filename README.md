# Semantic-Spotter-using-Llama-Index


For this project, weâ€™re developing a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) large language model (LLM) using the LLAMA index. The goal is to create a powerful question-answering system that leverages both retrieval and generation capabilities to provide accurate and contextually rich responses.
